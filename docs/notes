One control function command instructs the DS18S20 to perform a temperature measurement. The result
of this measurement will be placed in the DS18S20’s scratch-pad memory, and may be read by issuing a
memory function command which reads the contents of the scratchpad memory. The temperature alarm
triggers TH and TL consist of 1-byte EEPROM each. If the alarm search command is not applied to the
DS18S20, these registers may be used as general purpose user memory. Writing TH and TL is done
using a memory function command. Read access to these registers is through the scratchpad. All data is
read and written least significant bit first.


The idle state for the 1–Wire bus is high.
